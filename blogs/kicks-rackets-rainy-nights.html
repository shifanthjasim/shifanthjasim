When I think back to my days at Dharmaraja College Kandy, the biggest Buddhist school in Sri Lanka (and yes, the coolest if you ask me), I can’t help but chuckle.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Badminton: The Early Morning Ritual</h3>
            <p>Let’s start with my deep love for badminton. My best friends, Yohan and Kalana, and I were so passionate about the game that we’d wake up at the crack of dawn—well, actually, it was more like 3 AM. Yes, you heard that right! While other kids were dreaming of candy and toys, we were dreaming of smashing shuttlecocks and serving aces. Armed with our rackets, we’d stealthily creep out of our homes like ninjas, ready to conquer the badminton court before the world even knew we were awake!</p>
            
            <p>Picture this: two sleepy-eyed boys, rackets in hand, trying to shatter the silence of the night with the sound of a shuttlecock being whacked around. Our neighbors must have thought we were either training for the Olympics or plotting some sort of secret mission. The only thing we were really plotting was how to score points and maybe a little breakfast afterward.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Late Nights and Badminton Fights</h3>
            <p>Our dedication didn’t end at sunrise. Oh no! We were known to play badminton until 11 PM. Our parents must have thought we were getting some quality sleep, but little did they know, we were perfecting our serves and sneaky drop shots. If you could hear our laughter echoing through the night, it probably sounded like a comedy show in the making.</p>

            <p>After our late-night badminton sessions, we had another quirky tradition: ice cream! Yes, you read that right. Yohan, Kalana, and I would brave the pouring cold rain, ice cream cones in hand, like true champions. I can still picture the baffled looks on people’s faces as we stood there, shivering and grinning like idiots, savoring our cold treats while they rushed past us, umbrellas in tow. Nothing like a midnight ice cream run in a downpour to solidify our status as the coolest kids in Kandy—or maybe the craziest!</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Kalana: The King of Crazy</h3>
            <p>Now, let’s talk about Kalana—our very own daredevil and resident crazy guy! Kalana was famous for doing the wildest things that would make your head spin. If there was a challenge, you could bet he’d be the first one to take it on. Whether it was attempting to jump off the swings like he was training for the circus or trying to slide down the banister like a secret agent, Kalana had a flair for the dramatic.</p>

            <p>I remember one time during a badminton break, he decided it was a brilliant idea to skateboard down a hill… in the rain! Picture this: Kalana flying down the hill with the grace of a gazelle—only to end up in a muddy puddle, looking like a very confused, very soggy raccoon. We laughed so hard, I’m surprised we didn’t wake the entire neighborhood!</p>

            <p>Kalana’s antics were legendary. Whether it was pulling off outrageous pranks on teachers or doing a spontaneous dance in the middle of a serious discussion, he always kept us on our toes. Thanks to him, our school life was a series of unforgettable moments filled with laughter and a bit of chaos!</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Kindergarten Chronicles: The Introvert and the Protector</h3>
            <p>Now, let’s rewind to my days in Montessori Kindergarten. I was a little introvert, not quite ready to embrace the wild world of other kids. Enter Sachini, my best friend and the superhero of my kindergarten days. While I was busy worrying about how to navigate the jungle of kids, she was my shield against the chaos. With her around, I felt invincible—well, at least as invincible as a shy kid could feel while clinging to his best friend like a koala bear.</p>

            <p>It’s funny to think about how I was so introverted that I was scared of the other kids, while Sachini bravely took on the role of my protector. I can imagine her standing up to the other kids, saying, “Hey, back off! This one’s mine!” I owe a huge thanks to Sachini for keeping me safe during those tumultuous times. Without her, I might have been the “scared kid” legend in the kindergarten hall of fame!</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Dharmaraja College: The Grand Institution</h3>
            <p>Now, let’s talk about my school, Dharmaraja College Kandy. It’s not just a school; it’s a majestic institution with a rich history and a stunning campus. Founded in 1887, it’s a place where knowledge meets tradition, and where every wall has a story to tell. I mean, it’s the biggest Buddhist school in Sri Lanka! There’s so much culture and wisdom swirling around; I half expected to bump into ancient monks discussing philosophy while I was trying to figure out my math homework.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">The Badminton Legend</h3>
            <p>And speaking of legends, my best friend Yohan is now the rank 2 national badminton player in Sri Lanka. It’s hilarious to think that the same kid I once snuck out to play badminton with at 3 AM is now out there smashing it on a national level. I can only imagine him strutting onto the court, racket in hand, as fans cheer him on, while I’m at home wondering if I should take up badminton again or stick to my current life of coding and collecting stamps.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">The Mischievous Memories</h3>
            <p>So, there you have it! My school life was filled with laughter, sports, and a fair share of chaos. From waking up at the crack of dawn for badminton games to late-night ice cream runs in the rain, every moment was a story waiting to be told. I wouldn’t trade those memories for anything in the world, and I’m grateful for the friends who made every adventure a little crazier. Here’s to school life—the laughter, the antics, and the unforgettable friendships!</p>
