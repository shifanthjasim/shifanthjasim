    <section class="blog-content py-5 bg-danger text-white">
        <div class="container">
            <p><span class="big-letter">H</span>ey! Today, we will be discussing something that keeps me awake at night — my beloved programming languages! Ugggggh — they’re so much fun and so maddening at the same time, huh?</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">JavaScript</h3>
            <p>First up is JavaScript. Wow, what a ride! He is the wild friend who walks in and flips everything on its head. In one moment you are happily coding and in another, BAM! A bunch of error messages come your way and you are still like, “Wait what?!”</p>
            <p>But the thing is when you eventually find the solution? It feels amazing! One night, I got really into some React-type stuff and felt like a genius. Then BAM — “this undefined.” Seriously? I said, for a minute, “What the hell am I doing with my life?!”</p>
        
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Python</h3>
            <p>Next is Python. Aah, like a cozy sweater on a brisk night. It’s so easy and comfy! When I first opened a Python file, it was like that light bulb going on in Dr. Skinner’s head. The syntax is super clean and it all just makes sense. It also, then, has a downside of its own.</p>
            <p>This is not a drill when it comes to dependencies! I was only trying to install a library, and then—BAM! Everything went crazy. Ever feel like you are solving a puzzle but lose half of the pieces and end up with this? At 2 AM one night that was me, looking at my screen blankly trying to understand. Certainly, I found myself on YouTube again, with my fingers crossed that “this time will be different!”</p>
        
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>Oh, and of course, how could I miss Bootstrap? This is the equivalent of that loyal friend who shows up with snacks when you are hungry. I used it constantly when I first got started, AND you know what? It was making my sites look a hell of a lot prettier than they should’ve. But in the end, I started feeling like I was also using these same templates that are being used by everyone. All websites start to blend together, you know? Yeah, not what I wanted!</p>
            <p>And I was like “Well~ Time to behave as my own self!” Or should I say, as I tried to integrate my own color touches attempting to liven things up the (failings of) some of my designs began looking an awful lot like a rainbow tornado had passed through. But hey, such is the learning! You are sent to get it right and other times? Not so much.</p>
        
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Sleepless Nights</h3>
            <p>So then, why do these languages trouble my sleep? I mean, it’s just like a rollercoaster and all different types of emotions. How many sleepless nights have I had trying to work out why my code isn’t working? Feeling all the feels is a rollercoaster! The fun of building something neat but with bugs keeping you up all night? Fun, right?</p>
            <p>So, I want to know your stories! Have any amusing coding fails or midnight escapades? Am I the only one losing sleep over this stuff!?</p>
            
            <p>Alright, catch ya later!</p>
